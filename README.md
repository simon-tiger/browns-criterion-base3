A cool number guessing trick using Brown's Criterion in Base 3

This is the code for creating the five cards in Processing and exporting the images as png files. 
To play the game, have someone think of a number between 0 and 242 and let that person look 
for his/her number on every card and tell you which colour it is on every card. Every card stands 
for a power of 3: 81, 27, 9, 3, and 1. There are three grids of numbers on every card, 
a blue grid (representing the zeros in base 3), a red grid (representing the ones in base 3), 
and a green grid (representing the twos in base 3). After your friend has found his/her number on all the five cards, 
you can go ahead and add all the results up to guess the number. Alternatively, if you find working with base 3 too difficult, 
just sum up all the red numbers in the top left corners (on all the cards where your friend's number was red), 
then double all the red numbers in the top left corners (on all the cards where your friend's number was green) 
and add all of those together to guess the number.
